PREMISE
----------
First, I believe you're a user of a great Vim plugin ctrlp.vim.
Otherwise, you need to install it before start installing this plugin.
Second, this plugin requires tmux to open a new SSH window (currently).


CONFIGURATION
----------
You need to make this plugin available as a ctrlp.vim extension. Please add *ssh* to a variable `g:ctrlp_extensions`.

    let g:ctrlp_extensions = [ 'ssh' ]

Or if you already use other ctrlp.vim extensions you need to do like this:

    let g:ctrlp_extensions = [ 'funky', 'ssh' ]

Then restart Vim and you can use `:CtrlPSSH` command.

It might be useful mapping like:

    nnoremap <Leader>fs :CtrlPSSH<Cr>
